## Solid Electron
This is a bare bones Electron app that uses Solid JS as the front end.

`src/main/ipc.ts` is the entry point for all IPC communication definitions on the electron side.

`src/render/electron.d.ts` is where the IPC definitions are defined for the front end.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
